# Do you know that Indigenous people are receiving a lack of education? 

Indigenous Helper, a Computer Science course summative project created in 2024, aims to raise awareness and execute changes about Indigenous issues.

### Mission
To do this, players could build schools and public institutes to reestablish communities and fix the issues by helping community members and combining building blocks that stimulate the actual process. Players could not only experience the difficult life of Indigenous people but also figure out a way to assist them and make the community prosperous. 

By playing the game, it is wished that all the players could notice the occurring issues and advocate for changes in the real world

## Aspects of the project
- **Intro Panel**: The introduction panel is a welcome page for the player to enter their name.

- **Main panel**: Here will be the place for the graphics and main storyline. The story is mainly about helping Indigenous people and rebuilding the community. Players could upgrade the buildings by collecting “maple leaves” in the game panel, and every time the player upgrades, his/her level increases and gains money as a reward(stimulating profit made). 

- **GUI:** The main panel includes a top, right, center, bottom, and left panel. 
The top panel outputs the player's number of money, maple leaves, and name. 
The left panel indicates the player's level, and the bottom layer includes a picture related to the story, the storyline, and a submit button to upgrade the community.
The center panel outputs pictures of the community and changes as the story progresses. 
The right panel has a menu that players can click to go to the game panel or the shop. 

- **Game Panel:**
Users can complete missions to help indigenous people and gain maple leaves to upgrade the community in the main panel. The missions are similar to real needs and are designed for players to achieve by combining a certain level of elements. They are like small instructions for players to follow to accomplish the task in the main storyline. Players could spend money to buy elements, combine(upgrade) them, and solve missions related to Indigenous issues. As a result, maple leaves are rewarded as a gift for helping them. All elements are settled in a grid and are generated randomly in a range of levels.
